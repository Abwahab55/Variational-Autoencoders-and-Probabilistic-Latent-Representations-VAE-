# Variational Autoencoders and Probabilistic Latent Representations (VAE)
This implementation presents a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch, applied to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. VAEs are generative models that learn latent representations of data by optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Unlike standard autoencoders, VAEs encode the input into a distribution over latent variables rather than a single point, allowing for better generalization and data generation capabilities.

The code is structured into the following main components:
Model Architecture: Defines the encoder and decoder networks. The encoder maps input images to a latent space characterized by a mean and log-variance, while the decoder reconstructs images from sampled latent vectors using the reparameterization trick.

Loss Function: Combines reconstruction loss (binary cross-entropy between input and output) and KL divergence to regularize the latent space toward a standard normal distribution.

Training Loop: Uses the MNIST dataset to train the VAE. The model learns to encode input digits into latent representations and reconstruct them through gradient descent optimization.

Sampling & Visualization: After training, the model can generate new digit-like images by sampling from the latent space, demonstrating its ability to learn the underlying data distribution.
This code serves as a foundational reference for understanding probabilistic latent variable models, unsupervised learning, and generative deep learning techniques.
